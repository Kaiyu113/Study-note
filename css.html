    css selector
        CSS selectors are patterns used to select elements within an HTML document so that you can apply styles to them.
            1. Universal Selector (*)
                * {
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
                }
            2. Type Selector
                Selects all elements of a given type.
                p {
                font-size: 16px;
                }
            3. Class Selector (.classname)
                Selects all elements with a specified class.
                .button {
                background-color: blue;
                color: white;
                }
            4. ID Selector (#idname)
                #header {
                background-color: grey;
                }
            5. Attribute Selector
                Selects elements based on the presence or value of a specific attribute.
                input[type="text"] {
                border: 1px solid #ccc;
                }
            6. Descendant Selector (E F)
                Selects elements that are descendants of another element.
                div p {
                color: green;
                }
            7. Child Selector (E > F)
                ul > li {
                list-style: none;
                }
            8. Adjacent Sibling Selector (E + F)
                Selects an element that is immediately preceded by another element.
                h1 + p {
                margin-top: 0;
                }
            9. General Sibling Selector (E ~ F)
                h1 ~ p {
                color: grey;
                }
            10. Pseudo-class Selector
                Selects elements based on their state or position.

                a:hover {
                color: red;
                }

                :first-child — Selects the first child of a parent.
                li:first-child {
                font-weight: bold;
                }

                :nth-child(n) — Selects the nth child of a parent.
                li:nth-child(2) {
                color: blue;
                }
            11. Pseudo-element Selector
                Selects a part of an element.
                ::before — Inserts content before the content of an element.
                ::after — Inserts content after the content of an element.
                ::first-line — Selects the first line of text.
                ::first-letter — Selects the first letter of text.
                p::before {
                content: "Note: ";
                font-weight: bold;
                }
                p::after {
                content: " [End of paragraph]";
                }
            12. Grouping Selector
                Groups multiple selectors to apply the same styles to all of them.
                h1, h2, h3 {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                }
    rank
        !important
    center item
        flexbox
            父元素
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 100vh;//必须得加上height
             子元素
            宽高
        margin子元素(水平居中/上下会被margin collapse,可以使用out of document flow去解决 margin collapse)
            margin: auto 
        transfrom(会脱离文档流)
            position: absolute;//把position设置为absolute；使其脱离文档流
                Writing Banner Text on an Image
                To overlay banner text on an image, you can use CSS positioning. The basic idea is to place the image and the text inside a container and use absolute positioning to place the text over the image.
            //把位置放在中间
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            把element的中心点放在中间
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        硬算
     margin collapse
         the top and bottom margin of blocks will combine into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margin(or just one of it if they are equal)
         when no content separating parent and descendants, the margin top and bottom will collapse, The collapsed margin ends up outside the parent.
         you can use border, padding, inline part, block formatting context
         floating & absolute positioned never collapse
     BFC(Block formatting context)
         is a rendering rule. Elements with BFC attributes can be thought of as isolated containers in which the elements in the container don't affect the outer elements layout
         bfc can prevents margins collapsing //在外面包一层<p> ｜｜ 使用overflow: auto放在父元素
         bfc stops content wrapping floats. //使用overflow: auto.放在父元素，父元素形成isolated container，里面的element不会影响外面的元素
         //放在子元素，子元素形成isolated container，里面的element不会影响外面的元素
     Pseudo-classes
         A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name 
         selector:pseudo class{
         property: value; 
         }
         :hover
         :active
         :first-child
         :invalid
         :focus
     Pseudo-element
         A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
         selector::pseudo-element {
         property: value;
         }
         ::after
         ::before
         ::first-letter
         ::first-line
     position:
         absolute: 
             An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
             Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
             if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
         fixed:
             An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
             Note: fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
         relative:
             An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
     removed the element from the normal flow
         float:left;
         position:absolute;
         posotion:fix
     BEM
         block：模块，名字单词间用 - 连接
         element：元素，模块的子元素，以 __ 与 block 连接
         modifier：修饰，模块的变体，定义特殊模块，以 -- 与 block 连接
    Absolute Units
        PX: On the device itself, the PX unit is fixed and does not change based on any other element, relative to the DPI and resolution of the viewing device. 
        Relative Units
        EM: the unit is relative to the font size of its parent element,
        REM: relative to the root font size of the HTML document
        %: Relative to the parent element
        VW: Relative to the viewport’s width, i.e. 50vw = 50%ViewportWidth
        VH: Relative to the viewport’s height
    css animation
        slide {
        /* display: none; */
        animation-name: fade;
        animation-duration: 2s;
        }

        @keyframes fade {
        from {
            opacity: 0.4;
        }
        to {
            opacity: 1;
        }
        }
    Box Model

        Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
        Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
        Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

    It's a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to make web content and web applications more accessible,
differ/async attribute in <script/>
    asnyc
        the script is fetched asynchronously and executed as soon as it is available.\
            Use async when: The script is independent and doesn’t rely on other scripts or affect other scripts
    differ
        script is fetched asynchronously but is executed only after the HTML parsing is complete.
            Use defer when: The script relies on other scripts or must be executed in a specific order.
CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift
     which is a metric used to measure visual stability in web pages.

display
<!-- 
display
none: The element is not displayed and does not take up any space in the layout.
block: The element is displayed as a block, taking up the full width available. It starts on a new line.
inline: The element is displayed inline, taking up only as much width as necessary. It does not start on a new line.
inline-block: The element is displayed as an inline element, but it behaves like a block element. It does not start on a new line, but you can set width and height.
flex: The element becomes a flexible container with a flex layout. Its children become flex items.
grid: The element becomes a grid container, and its children become grid items.
    grid
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
    }
    .grid-item {
        padding: 20px;
        text-align: center;
    }
    <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-item">1</div>
        <div class="grid-item">2</div>
        <div class="grid-item">3</div>  
        <div class="grid-item">4</div>
        <div class="grid-item">5</div>
        <div class="grid-item">6</div>  
    </div>
inline-flex: Similar to flex, but the element itself is inline.
inline-grid: Similar to grid, but the element itself is inline.
table: The element behaves like a <table> element.
inline-table: The element behaves like an inline <table>.
list-item: The element behaves like a <li> element, which is typically used inside lists.
