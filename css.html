        transfrom(会脱离文档流)
            position: absolute;//把position设置为absolute；使其脱离文档流
            //把位置放在中间
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            把element的中心点放在中间
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        硬算
     margin collapse
         the top and bottom margin of blocks will combine into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margin(or just one of it if they are equal)
         when no content separating parent and descendants, the margin top and bottom will collapse, The collapsed margin ends up outside the parent.
         you can use border, padding, inline part, block formatting context
         floating & absolute positioned never collapse
     BFC(Block formatting context)
         is a rendering rule. Elements with BFC attributes can be thought of as isolated containers in which the elements in the container don't affect the outer elements layout
         bfc can prevents margins collapsing //在外面包一层<p> ｜｜ 使用overflow: auto放在父元素
         bfc stops content wrapping floats. //使用overflow: auto.放在父元素，父元素形成isolated container，里面的element不会影响外面的元素
         //放在子元素，子元素形成isolated container，里面的element不会影响外面的元素
     Pseudo-classes
         A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name 
         selector:pseudo class{
         property: value; 
         }
         :hover
         :active
         :first-child
         :invalid
         :focus
     Pseudo-element
         A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
         selector::pseudo-element {
         property: value;
         }
         ::after
         ::before
         ::first-letter
         ::first-line
     position:
         absolute: 
             An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
             Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
             if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
         fixed:
             An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
             Note: fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
         relative:
             An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
     removed the element from the normal flow
         float:left;
         position:absolute;
         posotion:fix
     BEM
         block：模块，名字单词间用 - 连接
         element：元素，模块的子元素，以 __ 与 block 连接
         modifier：修饰，模块的变体，定义特殊模块，以 -- 与 block 连接
    Absolute Units
        PX: On the device itself, the PX unit is fixed and does not change based on any other element, relative to the DPI and resolution of the viewing device. 
        Relative Units
        EM: the unit is relative to the font size of its parent element,
        REM: relative to the root font size of the HTML document
        %: Relative to the parent element
        VW: Relative to the viewport’s width, i.e. 50vw = 50%ViewportWidth
        VH: Relative to the viewport’s height
    css animation
        slide {
        /* display: none; */
        animation-name: fade;
        animation-duration: 2s;
        }

        @keyframes fade {
        from {
            opacity: 0.4;
        }
        to {
            opacity: 1;
        }
        }
